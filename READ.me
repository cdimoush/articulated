3D printed arm project!

What do I know about arms? Not enough 

Goal: Design and code my own 4-6 dof arm from scratch

Status: 1/27 The prototype of the arm has been printed (2Dof and growing). I am currently working on electronics
and stepper drivers and ik. Each stepper is controlled designated its own arduino nano. The nanos speak with
ros through pyserial (I don't trust rosserial)

Status: 2/9 Joints state gui is used to control the 2 steppers. Forward kinematics have been programmed but are not currently integrated.
